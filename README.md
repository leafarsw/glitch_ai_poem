Ideas that came to my mind:

"Here's a summary of how Poetrix(glitch_ai_poem_dapp) can be transformed into an art making app to serve the community and raise funds for LGBT+ causes in Brazil:

Poetrix is a collaborative art making app that combines AI-generated glitched pixel art avatars with poetry or short text prompts. The app enables users to create their own unique avatar and contribute it to a larger collection of NFTs, which can be minted on the Polygon blockchain. Users can also collaborate with others by adding their own text prompts to existing avatars, which can then be transformed into new and unique glitched pixel art avatars.

The collection of NFTs generated by the Poetrix app can be sold to raise funds for LGBT+ causes in Brazil. The app serves as a bridge between Web2 and Web3, making it easy for users to participate in creating and collecting art while also supporting a worthy cause. The app can be designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to easily create, collaborate, and collect NFTs.

By using AI-generated glitched pixel art avatars and poetry or short text prompts, Poetrix creates a unique and collaborative art-making experience that allows users to express themselves creatively and support a worthy cause. The app can be a valuable addition to the growing world of blockchain-based NFTs, and can have a positive impact on the community it serves."
